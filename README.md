## Ranen Swilling

I love working hard on things I care about, and work well within diverse groups and
independently. I am an honest, loyal and tenacious individual. I am quietly confident and easy to
get along with. I articulate myself well and have good writing abilities. I believe my sense of
initiative and high levels of enthusiasm will make me an asset to any team. 

I recently completed a Masters at Stellenbosch University. The day after I completed my studies, I applied for a UK ancestral visa and decided to focus all my time and energy in becoming a better software development.
